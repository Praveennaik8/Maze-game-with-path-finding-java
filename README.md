# Maze-game-with-path-finding-java
The goal of this project is to gain some experience in GUI programming, while simultaneously implementing and using the design practices and tools learned throughout the course. We are going to implement a maze game using Java Eclipse IDE with GUI interface. The maze game is a game in which the purpose of the game is for the player to make their way from the start point to the end point. The layout of the maze is such that the player must follow a series of narrow winding corridors with many false turns and dead-ends until they eventually reach the finish point. PROBLEM STATEMENT The task is to design and implement a maze game using object oriented programming concepts and GUI interface (i.e. Java Swing). The game must have n number of levels which can be added by the admin. The user should be provided with a set of instructions about the game and there must be time bound within which he/she has to clear the level, failing to do so would block his/her entry to the next level. The user should also be provided with an option to view the solution to clear the level, which must be implemented using a shortest path search algorithm.
